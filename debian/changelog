bps (1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Modified `bps_monitor` to check the current installation
  * Added `bps_monitor` to this repository
  * Split `autodidact` and `bps` (with `uvt_user`) into two separate
    repositories
  * Rewrote the uvt_user app and BPS configuration to allow regular
    logins as well as CAS logins
